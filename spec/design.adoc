== Design

This section describes design rationale of the Onyx language and accompanying standards.

Infer as much as possible, unless ambiguous.

Multiple syntaxes to achieve the same task is appropriate in some cases.

It is good to have full-character, short-character and symbolic representation of something so a developer could choose between readability and code size.
For example, `equals?`, `eq` and `==`.

The language is built on a finite set of simple rule blocks.
A lesser set is better.
For example, function and generic arguments follow the same semantics and syntax.

=== Annotations VS keywords

The less keywords are in the language, the better.

Reuse keywords as much as possible.

If an annotation is very often used, consider replacing it with a keyword.
However, low-level annotations should not be keywords.
For example, `@[Align]` and `@[Volatile]` are annotations and not variable modifiers.
