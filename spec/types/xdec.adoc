= Decimal fixed-point

If bitsize is greater than required to store the digits, then the value of unused bits is undefined.

[[dpd-bitsize-omitted]]
If a decimal fixed-point type has its bitsize omitted, it is then calculated in accordance to the xref:dpd-bitsize-formula[].

[[dpd-bitsize-formula]]
.DPD bitsize formula
```nx
bitsize = digits / 3 * 10 + (3 * digits % 3 + 1) + signed? ? 1 : 0
```

The following table contains examples of applying the xref:dpd-bitsize-formula[], where DPD bitsize varies based on if the number is signed or not.
