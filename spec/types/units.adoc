= Units

A unit type is an object, but it only exists in a single instance and does not occupy any memory in runtime.

.Unit type declaration syntax
[syntax]
----
(* A unit type declaration. *)
unit =
  type_visibility_mod,

  (* !keyword(Unit type declaration) *)
  "unit",

  id,
  [generic_args_decl],

  ";" | block();
----

A unit type may derive from a trait.

A unit type shall not extend any other types.

Unit members do not have storage.
Unit members may be accessed both in namespace- and object-access styleinfo:[, for example `Unit.foo()` is equivalent to `Unit::foo()`].

[info]
--
Akin to instance members in an object, unit functions are also referenced as _(unit) methods_, and unit values -- as _(unit) fields_.
--

Within a unit method implementation, `this` is equivalent to `self`.

TODO: An instance storage bound to a unit always expands to the static storage.

A unit type is a functor with zero arity.
A call to a unit type returns itself.

  def get_x
    return x
  end

assert(Foo == Foo())
assert(Foo.x == Foo::x)
