== Syntax

This specification uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[EBNF] for language and other syntax definition, unless mentioned another.

TIP: The entire compiled syntax can be found in xref:_compiled_syntax[].

// TODO: Need more specification, maybe add syntax for this.
The specification extends EBNF with variables: a nonterminal may have a list of arguments prefixed with `$` with optional default values, wrapped in parentheses.
Once referenced within the nonterminal production rule, an argument is immediately replaced with its value.
Recursion and nested variables are allowed.
A nonterminal with arguments must always be used with parentheses, even if there are no actual arguments.

.Using variables in EBNF syntax
====
[source,ebnf]
----
foo($arg = "none") = "bar" | $arg;

a = foo();      (* Expands to `"bar" | "none";`)
b = foo("qux"); (* Expands to `"bar" | "qux";` *)
c = foo(b);     (* Expands to `"bar" | "bar" | "qux";` *)

.Fundamental syntax
[syntax]
----
binary = "0" | "1";
octal = binary | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8";
digit = octal | "8" | "9";

(* Design rationale: hexadecimals are in upper-case to clearly
  distingusigh them from exponents and prefixes (`Q` and `D`
  are exceptions). Multiplier prefixes can not be used in
  hexadecimal literals, so they don't mix. *)
hex = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F";

(* Any Unicode abstract character, including
  those consisting of multiple codepoints. *)
unicode = (? A Unicode character ?);
