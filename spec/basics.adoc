= Basics

Declaration::
Declaring a entity tells a compiler about its existence.
A declaration of the same entity may occur multiple times.
Declaration allows implementation of functions.

Implementation::
Only a previously declared entity shall be implemented.

Definition::
Defining means declaration and implementation, in a single statement.

Most of the time, correctness is lazily checked upon actual reference rather than at the moment of declaration.
For example, a function body would be checked for semantic correctness on each specialization.
Or trait implementation correctness.

TODO: Begin with code which just-works (use structs), depends on how powerful a compiler is to optimize that.
Then begin applying unsafe and wordy optimizations (explicit vectors, pointer arithmetics, target-specific types or even instructions, raw assembly).
Blackbox unless explicitly accessed.

TODO: CLI -- provide "debug", "development" and "production" modes.
