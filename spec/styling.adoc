= Styling

This section is dedicated to styling guidelines for the specification.

During the development of the specification, the following goals shall be followed, in the descending order of importance:

1. Unambiguity:
* Prefer duplication over complexity where needed;
1. Lower mental overhead:
* Prefer long forms over shortcuts, e.g. _has not_ is better than _hasn't_;
* *Emphasize* where accent is needed;

When mentioning a thesis, if it is under the same or lower heading level, then it is not required to link to its origin or explain.
However, if the distance between mentioning and origin is subjectively big, then it is okay to link to the origin.

Prefer *emphasizing* over SCREAMING CASE.

== List styling

A non-last item of a list shall be soft-terminated with `;`.

The last item of a list shall be hard-terminated, e.g. with `.`.

If a list item is opening a new list, it then shall end with a `:`.
