= Scope

This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the Onyx programming language. It describes:

* The representation of Onyx programs;
* The syntax and constraints of the Onyx language;
* The semantic rules for interpreting Onyx programs;
* The restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of Onyx.

This specification does not describe:

* The mechanism by which Onyx programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;
* The mechanism by which Onyx applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;
* The mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a Onyx application;
* The mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a Onyx application;
* The size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data- processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
* All minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.
